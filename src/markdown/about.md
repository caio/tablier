fast recipe search experience. The [code is open source][code]
and soon the data will be too.

## Not a Product, Not a Business

This was created and is still developed as a hobby project, meaning
that in here there's a lot of perceived value in having fun, pacing
myself, keeping things lean and sticking to my ideals.

Sustainability is a goal, profitability isn't. Traditional ads will
never have a place here, which means there's no incentive to making
things inefficient: I want you to be able to find a recipe and get to
cooking as quickly as possible, not keep you using this site for long
just so that I can show you a lot of ads.

## History

Autumn 2017, obese [me][me] decides to fix some of my bad habits and
engages in cooking mostly low-carb meals daily and using
[r/progresspics](https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/) and similar as
the main motivation driver.

While the weight was going down, a series of frustrations with the
status-quo of searching for recipes started building up: pervasive
tracking, ads everywhere, excessive interactivity, subscription walls,
rubbish generated content to drive traffic and slow data-heavy pages.

A year and 50+ kg (110 lbs) lost later, I found myself wanting to give
back to the community, but unable to do so since sharing my success
story via before/after pictures triggered too many concerns related to
privacy and misuse (and self confidence, of course).

Meanwhile, I started writing a simple tool to help me manage the
somewhat big list of recipe links I had collected over time:
A plain-text file wasn't good enough anymore, the existing websites
offering a similar thing hadn't improved on my gripes over time (quite
the opposite, actually).

I quickly found myself writing scrapers for my favorite sites to make
it easier to extract the recipes out of the wall of text that usually
precedes the real content. After a few iterations of doing just that,
things started clicking and I went from a small hand-crafted database
of about 100 recipes to 10 thousand recipes with little effort; A few
more tweaks and forgetting the crawler running overnight left me with
around 100 thousand recipes.

And then things got interesting :-) Growing this to the current 1+M
database size took more time than effort and I finally had something
that I could do to keep me entertained for a while _and_ give back to
the community: a recipe search engine that doesn't have all of those
annoying things we all have to deal with in today's web.

# Acknowledgments

This project was created as a one-man show: [Caio][me] takes care of
everything from the firewalls to what you are reading right now, but
that's not to say there hasn't been help from tools and third parties:

* SVG Icons come from the [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) free icon pack,

* The [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io/) made my life a lot easier
* [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/) powers the search
  functionality and reading its code always teaches me a _lot_.
