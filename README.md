# Tablier

Tablier is [gula.recipes][gula]'s front-end. All non-recipe content is
in or generated by this repository. Notably, templates are type-checked
via [rocker][] and the CSS framework is [Bulma][bulma].

[gula]: https://gula.recipes
[rocker]: https://github.com/fizzed/rocker
[bulma]: https://bulma.io

This repository is a mess, but what it does is:

1. Generate static page versions of templates (via Generator.java)
   using the Rocker views and the `.model` package classes

2. Compile markdown files into html documents

3. Use docker to compile bulma with variable customizations and
   extra classes via gulp (`gulfile.js`, `sass` task)

4. Use the generated static pages to clean up (`uncss`) and minify
   (`cssnano`) the generated css so that we end up with a somewhat
   small stylesheet (again via gulp: `gulpfile.js`, `css` task)

5. Package it all inside a jar


## Build

    mvn install

## Watch for template/content changes

    mvn -Pwatch exec:java

## Generate CSS

    mvn exec:exec@minify-css
